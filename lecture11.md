# Lecture 11: 
This is the most important lecture for you, if you want to get our code parallelized that we developed in Lecture 5 and 6. When I say 'parallelize', I mean both multi-core (OpenMP) and multi-node (MPI). After talking about how to parallelize nested "do-loops" in the last lecture, here I showed how to use the parallelized FFTW library. Thus at the end of the lecture, all of you become potentially capable to write an OpenMP and MPI parallel two dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equation solver! Start with the code we developed in [Lecture 5](lecture5.md) and [6](lecture6.md). Make all the "do-loops" parallel using the prescription in [Lecture 9](lecture9.md) and replace all the FFTW calls using the prescription in [Lecture 10](lecture10.md). You are all set!!!
