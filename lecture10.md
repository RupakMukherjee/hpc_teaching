# Lecture 10: 
Here I went to 2D arrays! Basically I extended the "do-loop" example I described in the last lecture for two dimensional arrays. This extension is crucial since we will need it when you will be parallelizing the code we wrote up in [Lecture 5](https://rupakmukherjee.github.io/pseudo-spectral-crash-course/lecture5.html) and [6](https://rupakmukherjee.github.io/pseudo-spectral-crash-course/lecture6.html).
